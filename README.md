# RobotML
Project from WISEST Summer Research Program

This repo has the code used to run the servo-motors of the robot. It also contains the code which uses Reinforcement Learning algorithms (TD-lambda and actor-critic evaluation policy) and Machine Curiosity. The curiosity model is more specifically IGM(Information Gain Motivation).
